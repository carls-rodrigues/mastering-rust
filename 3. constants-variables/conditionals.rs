// Conditionals should also look familiar; they follow the C-like if...else pattern. Since
// Rust is strongly-typed, the condition must be a Boolean type:

fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    if condition {
        println!("Condition was true");
    } else {
        println!("Condition was false");
    }
}
